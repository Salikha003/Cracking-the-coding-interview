# Top coding interview concepts
- Heap top=O(1), insert=O(log n), remove=O(log n), heapify=O(n)
- Sliding window, two pointers
- Binary search O(log n)
- DFS & BFS
- Recursion (trees, graphs, backtracking, DP and more)
- HashMaps search=O(1), insert=O(1), remove=O(1)

# Algorithms Design Techniques
1. Recursive or iterative.
2. Brute force: Looks for all possible solutions, in the end select 1 solution.
3. Divide and Conquer: Divide input, recursively solve sub-problems, combine in the end. Recursive.
4. Dynamic Programming: The goal of DP is to solve the problem by combining solutions to sub-problems, never solving the same sub-problem twice. Types: memorization (top-down) & tabulation (bottom-up). Recursive.
5. Backtracking: Looks for all possible solutions, and as soon as it finds one, it stops searching. Recursive. Takes input, check constraints, if input is invalid undoes the choice (backtrack) and tries other options.
6. Greedy Method: At every step we select local optima, don't think about future.

# Strings

### ASCII

```
### ASCII - 26 English letters

128 chars from [0, 127], 7 bit
65 → 90, “A” → “Z”
97 → 122, “a” → “z”
ord(”a”) → 97
chr(97) → “a”
```

### Alphabet

```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

1. With capital letters [A, B, C ...]
alphabet = [chr(i) for i in range(65, 91)]

2. With lower case letters [a, b, c ...]
alphabet = [chr(i) for i in range(97, 123)]

3. Dictionary 
chars = {chr(ascii_val): ascii_val - 96 for ascii_val in range(97, 97 + 26)}
Returns: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4, 'e': 5, 'f': 6, 'g': 7, 'h': 8, 'i': 9, 'j': 10, 'k': 11, 'l': 12, 'm': 13, 'n': 14, 'o': 15, 'p': 16, 'q': 17, 'r': 18, 's': 19, 't': 20, 'u': 21, 'v': 22, 'w': 23, 'x': 24, 'y': 25, 'z': 26}
```

### String to integer conversion

```python
def str2int(num):
    int_ = 0
    for i in num:
        int_ = int_ * 10 + ord(i) - ord('0') # Or create a dict like "0": 0, "1":1 ....
    return int_
```

# Numbers (int, float)

### Arithmetic series sum

```python
def arith_sum(n:int):
    first_term = 1
        common_diff = 1
    sum_of_terms = (n * (2 * first_term + (n - 1) * common_diff)) // 2
    return sum_of_terms
```

### Get number of "1" bits

```
>>> n = 19
>>> bin(n)
'0b10011'
>>> bin(a).count('1')
3
>>> n.bit_count()
3
>>> (-n).bit_count()
3
```

# Array

### Transpose the matrix

```python
def transpose_matrix(matrix)
    return list(zip(*matrix)
```
