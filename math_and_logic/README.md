# Math and Logic

## Prime Number
- Every positive integer can be composed into a product of primes. Many primes will have an exponent of zero.

### Divisibility
- LCM (Lowest common multiple) = НОК (берем все большие и остатки)
- GCD (Greatest common divisor) = НОД (берем все меньшие)
- GCD * LCM = xy
