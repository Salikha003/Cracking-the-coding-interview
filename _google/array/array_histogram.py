Problem: Given array with heights of histogram bars, find the largest rectangle area.

Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.

        - If current bar is lower than the bar on top of stack, then calculate area of rectangle.
