Logger rate limiter: https://leetcode.com/problems/logger-rate-limiter/

Problem:
    Design a logger system that receives a stream of messages along with their timestamps.
    Each unique message should only be printed at almost every 10 seconds.

    All messages will come in chronological order. Several messages may arrive at the same timestamp.

    Implement the Logger class.
