Problem: find the shortest path from top left to bottom right in a binary matrix. Use only 0s.

Constraints:
    - Use 8 directions to traverse the matrix. (To right, to left, to top, to bottom, and diagonals)

Solution:
    - Use BFS to find the shortest path.
    - Time complexity: O(N^2)
    - Space complexity: O(N^2)
