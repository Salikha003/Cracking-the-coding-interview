Two sum, 2Sum: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

Problem: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Questions and constraints:
    - Do we have these 2 number that add up to sum?
    - Are there duplicates?
