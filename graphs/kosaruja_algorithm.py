"""
Kosaraju's algorithm to find strongly connected components.
Strongly connected components = directed graph (one way edges) in which there is a route between every two nodes.

Algorithm:
    1. Start DFS from vertex 0. Create "Visited set" and "stack".
    2. Visit all of its child vertices, and mark the visited vertices as done.
       If a vertex leads to an already visited vertex, or we reached the end, then push this vertex to the stack.
       Example: 3 -> 0. 0 is already visited. Then push 3 to the stack.
    3. Reverse the graph. Create new visited set. But we will use old stack.
    4. Start from the top vertex (the end) of the stack. Traverse through all of its child vertices. Once the already visited vertex is reached, one strongly connected component is formed.


Applications:
    - Vehicle routing applications
    - Maps
