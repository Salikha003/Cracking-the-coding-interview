"""
Depth First Search
    - Starts at any node and plunges a depth first into a graph (like a snake), until it cannot go any further
    - At point it can't go any further it backtracks and continues

Application of DFS Algorithm
    - For finding the path
    - To test if the graph is bipartite
    - For finding the strongly connected components of a graph
    - For detecting cycles in a graph

Time complexity: O(V+E), number vertices and edges
Space complexity: O(V)
