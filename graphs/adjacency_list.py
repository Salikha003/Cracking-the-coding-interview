Adjacency List (array of linked lists)

An adjacency list represents a graph as an array of linked lists.

The index of the array represents a vertex and
each element in its linked list represents the other vertices that form an edge with the vertex.

Pros of Adjacency List:
    - Memory efficient
    - 01. Easy to find all vertices adjacent to vertex easily
Cons of Adjacency List:
    - Finding is slow because all connected nodes need to be discovered first
