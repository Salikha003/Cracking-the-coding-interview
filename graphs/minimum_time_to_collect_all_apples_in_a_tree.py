"""1443. Minimum Time to Collect All Apples in a Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-collect-all-apples-in-a-tree/description/

NOTE!
    [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2]
    The edge [1,2] does not necessarily mean that node 1 is the parent of 2, but that there exists an edge between them.

Approach:
    - DFS Graph Algorithm
    - adjacency_list for edges should be bidirectional. Like (a, b) and (b, a).
      We will have a visited set, the nodes that are visisted will not be visited twice.
