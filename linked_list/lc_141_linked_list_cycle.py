Problem: 141. Linked List Cycle

Input: Linked list head
Output: True or False

SOLUTION 1:
    - Slow and fast pointers, Floyd's Cycle Detection
    - Traverse linked list using two pointers.
    = Move one pointer(slow_p) by one and another pointer(fast_p) by two.
    - If these pointers meet at the same node then there is a loop. If pointers do not meet then linked list doesnâ€™t have a loop.
    - Time: O(n)
    - Space: O(1)
