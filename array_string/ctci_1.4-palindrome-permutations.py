"""
Palindrome = same backwards and forwards
Permutation = rearrangement of letters

To be a permutation of a palindrome, a string can have NO MORE THAN one character that is odd.
For both even and odd cases.

Solution #1:
- Use map to count how many times each character appears
- Then iterate to ensure NO MORE than one char has an odd count
