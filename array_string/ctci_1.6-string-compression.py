String Compression

aabcccccaaa --> a2b1c5a3
If the compressed string would not become smaller than the original string, 
we method should return original string.

LEARNED:
How to solve --> "IndexError: string index out of range"

Solution #1 Time Complexity:
- O(p+k^2) where p is the size of string, k is the number of character sequences.
- k^2 because string concatenation operates in O(n^2)
    - "compressed_string += string[i] + str(count_consecutive)" this creates a new copy of a string over time
    - But if we use .append() to string somehow, copies will not be copied !???
